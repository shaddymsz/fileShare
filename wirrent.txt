The core idea is to establish peer to peer network inculcating few concepts of Blockchain, helping us to download files which will be accessed/downloaded from the systems(nodes) available on network.

Further there is no need of extra hardware to establish this network neither do we need to change the already existing network architecture, to run the network/application. 

This setup would be platform independent. Besides the above mentioned features, the speed for downloading is between 5mbps to 20mbps(depends on network infra of college)
